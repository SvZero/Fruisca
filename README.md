When a farmer does manual sorting of fruit, of course, this will take a lot of time, and this is also prone to human error which can lead to inefficiency in sorting fruit. and of course, this will have an impact on selling fruit to customers who buy fruit from it. From this problem, the question can be raised how can farmers make time efficiently in sorting rotten and fresh fruit? 

Our team wants to tackle this problem because we believe that Fruisca can benefit both consumers and the farmer that can detect whether the fruit is fresh or not so that it can make it easier for farmers to sort the fruit they harvest. Additionally, this application has the potential to promote healthier eating habits by encouraging consumers to consume fresh and nutritious fruits.
